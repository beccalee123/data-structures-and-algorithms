# FizzBuzz Tree
Conduct “FizzBuzz” on a tree while traversing through it. Change the values of each of the nodes dependent on the current node’s value

## Challenge
- Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a tree as an argument.
- Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, determine weather or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both, and change the value of each of the nodes:
- If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
- If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
- If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
- Return the tree with its new values.

## Approach & Efficiency
- We started by defining the problem domain and then moved on to drawing a visual
- From there, we wrote our algorithm and started coding
- We decided to break our code into two functions, one for handling the fizz buzz determination, and one to traverse through the tree to change values (as applicable)
- We coded everything out, and then put it into our computers
- We ran into a few issues while coding, but ran out of time to sort them out, so our code isn't 100% working at this point.
- As such, we also have not done testing.

Big O: O(n(log(n)))
