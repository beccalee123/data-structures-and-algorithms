# Shift an Array
Code Challenge 02 
12/18/2018
Paired on whiteboarding with Tanner Seramur

## Challenge:
Write a function called `insertShiftArray` which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Approach & Efficiancy
- Tanner and I began by definining the problem domain. This was largely provided by the Canvas assignment, but we needed to decide if we wanted to mutate our array or return a new one and leave the original unmuttable. We decided to return a new array.
- We then mapped out our visual and figured out how we would need to insert the value into the array to get the desired results.
- Once that was done, we did some initial work on our algorithm, which we revisted a few times as we worked on our code, and adjusted as needed.
- After we had that mapped out, we started in on our code, working through it piece by piece, and adjusting our approach as needed.
- Once we reached a solution we were happy with, we talked through it, made some adjustments, and then decided to move forward and test our code.
- Wehen we tested our code we ran into a couple of issues, but we ended up talking it out and got to some working code.
- We then set out to work on our assignment/tests individually.

The photo in the solution below shows what we landed on together.
